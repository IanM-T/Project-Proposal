# Project-Proposal

# I would like to code a mine sweeper like game. This is something I thought would be fun to do since it relates to the Animation and Games concentration of ATEC. 
# For the game, I would have to be able to click spaces on the screen as well as adding things like pygame and random. That way the program knows that it will be executed as a game and that the mines will be placed at random locations. 
# I think that the main challenge will be figuring out how to have the spaces (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) be coded as squares that can show how many mines are around them. 
# My ideal outcome for this project, I want to create something as close to the game mine sweeper as possible. I would also like to get it to be full screen, but if I am not able to do that then I will be fine with having it not be full screen.
# As for my milestones, I hope to be able to have the mines end the game when clicked on.
